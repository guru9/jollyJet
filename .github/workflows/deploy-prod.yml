# phase 3
name: Deploy to Production

# Production Environment Deployment Pipeline
# This workflow handles the secure deployment of the JollyJet application to
# production. It includes pre-deployment checks, manual approval gate,
# production image build, deployment, and post-deployment validation.

# Triggers:
# - Published releases (tagged with vX.Y.Z)
# - Manual workflow dispatch with specific tag and environment
