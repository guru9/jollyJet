# phase 2
name: CI/CD Pipeline for Current Branch

# Branch-Specific CI/CD Pipeline with Quality Gates
# This workflow provides a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for feature branches,
# develop branch, and main branch. It includes pre-flight checks, code quality
# verification, testing, security scanning, Docker image build, quality gate
# decision, and deployment.

# Triggers:
# - Push to main, develop, or feature branches
# - Pull requests to main or develop branches
# - Manual workflow dispatch

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, feature/*]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
